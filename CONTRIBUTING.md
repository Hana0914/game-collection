This guide expands the original contribution section from the README and explains how to collaborate effectively and respectfully.

 

## ðŸ§© How to Contribute

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository
```bash
git fork https://github.com/Hana0914/game-collection.git

Name your branch clearly based on what youâ€™re adding or fixing:
```bash
git checkout -b feat/add-new-game
git checkout -b fix/update-snake-logic
git checkout -b docs/improve-readme
```

### 3. Make Your Changes
You can contribute by:
- ðŸŽ® Adding a new mini-game (HTML/CSS/JS)
- ðŸ§  Improving existing games (graphics, logic, performance)
- â™¿ Enhancing accessibility (keyboard controls, color contrast)
- ðŸ§¾ Improving documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, etc.)
- ðŸ’… Updating visuals, layout, or UX for clarity and fun
- ðŸ§ª Adding basic tests or local checks

### 4. Commit Your Work

```
Then open a Pull Request on GitHub and describe what you changed and why.

 

## âœ… Pull Request Checklist

Before opening your PR, make sure to:
- [ ] Test the game locally (open in your browser)
- [ ] Keep the same code style and file structure
- [ ] Avoid unrelated edits or file renames
- [ ] Write a clear description of your contribution
- [ ] Confirm that all links and assets work

**Example of a good PR title:**
```
feat: add Flappy Bird clone with restart button
```

 

## ðŸ§  Tips for Contributors
- Prefer small, focused PRs â€” they get reviewed faster!  
- If unsure, open an **issue** first to discuss your idea.  
- Always test your changes in multiple browsers when possible.  
- Be kind and patient during reviews.  
- Contribute something that genuinely improves the project.  
- Avoid low-quality PRs (e.g., random text edits or empty files).  
- Remember: **Quality > Quantity** ðŸŽ¯

 

## ðŸ•¹ Local Testing

After cloning, open the main page in your browser:
```bash
open index.html
```
or on Windows:
```bash
start index.html
```

Each game is self-contained and can be launched directly.  
You can also use a local server for testing if you prefer:
```bash
npx serve .
```
